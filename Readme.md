To run the app locally run python app/index.py

See if you can find the hidden page!



Need to add in auth maybe?
Need to add in unit tests


PS dont worry about the .codesandbox stuff, its for a little IDE that 
I use on the iPad which lets me run the code in a little docker container. 
Its basically nonsense out side of that context. Feel free to test out 
codesandbox though, I think they have a web UI. I am managing with the free version.
There is also the ability to code on your phone as well!
